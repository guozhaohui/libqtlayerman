This application can be used to control some parts of the layermanager service.
It is supposed to run on a host that uses the D-Bus session bus over ethernet
to communicate with the layermanager service on the target.

Target setup:
=============
Add the following in the busconfig section of /etc/dbus-1/session.conf:

    <auth>ANONYMOUS</auth>
    <allow_anonymous/>
    <listen>tcp:host=0.0.0.0,port=12434</listen>

Before the service is started, export the following:
    export LM_USE_SESSION_BUS=enable


Host setup:
===========
Before the controller is invoked, export the following (adapt the IP address
to match your target):
    export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=tcp:host=172.25.165.171,port=12434
    export LM_USE_SESSION_BUS=enable
