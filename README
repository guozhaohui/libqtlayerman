Abstract
========
The qtlayerman library allows to run Qt applications controlled by the 
Genivi Layer Manager.

A sample Qt application can be found in example/

You will need to have Qt for X11 installed.

How to build the library and example
====================================
The LayerManager has to be build and installed.
(cmake ../layer_management/ -DWITH_DESKTOP=ON -DWITH_GLX_EXAMPLE=ON
 -DWITH_TESTS=OFF -DWITH_EGL_EXAMPLE=OFF -DWITH_X11_GLES=OFF -DWITH_XTHREADS=ON
 -DDBUS_ARCH_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dbus-1.0/include/)
Only the GLX version has been tested so far.

To build libqtlayerman and the example invoke the following commands in the
libqtlayerman directory:
$ qmake    # or /path/to/specific/qt/version/bin/qmake
$ make install
The library libqtlayerman will be installed in Qt's lib folder.

How to rund the example
=======================
Make sure there is no display or window manager running.
Start X Server, LayerManager, LayerManagerClientExample and the Qt app:
$ X &
$ export DISPLAY=:0
$ LayerManagerService/LayerManagerService &
$ LayerManagerExamples/LayerManagerClientExample/LayerManagerClientExample
$ cd example
$ ./example

General approach for Qt applications
====================================
The idea is that you simply have to replace your QApplication with 
QLayerManApplication and link against libqtlayerman and libilmClient.

The top-level window can be registered manually, as well:
QLayerManApplication::registerWindow(QWidget *win, ...)
If this method is not called, the top-level window will be registed
automatically when the QWidget::show() method is called.

Layer and Surface assignment
============================
The layer and surface, where the top-level window should be placed is determined
as follows:
1. By QLayerManApplication method calls:
   registerWindow(QWidget *win, t_ilm_surface surfaceId = 0xFFFFFFFF,
                                t_ilm_layer   layerId   = 0xFFFFFFFF);
   setSurface(t_ilm_surface surfaceId);
   setLayer  (t_ilm_layer   layerId);
2. As command line arguments ("-layer" and "-surface"), e.g.
   ./example -surface 20 -layer 2000
3. If none of the above is given, the layer defaults to 2000 and the surface
   will be determined by the layer manager.

Limitations and open issues
===========================
1. Only positioning of the top level window from Qt is supported (e.g. setting
   opacity etc. won't work)
