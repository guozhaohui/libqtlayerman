Abstract
========
The qtlayerman library allows to run Qt applications controlled by the 
Genivi Layer Manager.

An sample Qt application can be found in example/

You will need to have Qt for X11 installed.

How to build the library and example
====================================
The LayerManager has to be build and installed.
(cmake ../layer_management/ -DWITH_DESKTOP=ON -DWITH_GLX_EXAMPLE=ON
 -DWITH_TESTS=OFF -DWITH_EGL_EXAMPLE=OFF -DWITH_X11_GLES=OFF -DWITH_XTHREADS=ON
 -DDBUS_ARCH_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/dbus-1.0/include/)
Only the GLX version has been tested so far.

To building libqtlayerman and the example invoke the following commands in the 
libqtlayerman directory:
$ qmake    # or /path/to/specific/qt/version/bin/qmake
$ make
$ make install
The library libqtlayerman will be installed in Qt's lib folder.

How to rund the example
=======================
Make sure there is no display or window manager running.
Start X Server, LayerManager, LayerManagerClientExample and the Qt app:
$ X &
$ export DISPLAY=:0
$ LayerManagerService/LayerManagerService &
$ LayerManagerExamples/LayerManagerClientExample/LayerManagerClientExample &
$ cd example
$ ./example

General approach for Qt applications
====================================
The idea is that you simply have to replace your QApplication with 
QLayerManApplication and link against libqtlayerman and libilmClient.

The top-level window can be registered manually, as well:
QLayerManApplication::registerWindow(QWidget *win, ...)
If this method is not called, the top-level window will be registed
automatically when the QWidget::show() method is called.

Layer and Surface assignment
============================
The layer and surface, where the top-level window should be placed is determined
as follows:
1. As command line arguments ("-layer" and "-surface"), e.g.
   ./cube -layer 2000 -surface 20
   If provided, these values will overwrite the values below.
2. By QLayerManApplication method calls:
   registerWindow(QWidget *win, t_ilm_layer layer = 0, t_ilm_surface surface = 0)
   setLayer(t_ilm_layer layer);
   setSurface(t_ilm_layer surface);
3. If none of the above is given, the following default values are used:
   Layer:   2000
   Surface:   20

Limitations and open issues
===========================
1. Only one top-level window per Qt application is supported
2. Input (mouse and keyboard) is not supported yet
3. Only positioning of the top level window from Qt is supported (though the
   LayerManager doesn't support it currently)
4. Layer and surface with ID zero cannot be used (will become default values
   as given above)
